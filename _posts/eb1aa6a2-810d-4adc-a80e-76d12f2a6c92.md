# My Web Development Journey

When I first started learning to code, it was both exciting and overwhelming. I wasn’t sure where to begin, and I often found myself stuck between tutorials, tools, and tech stacks. But one thing that changed everything for me was starting my first real project.

## Starting Small

I began with the basics — HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Once I learned how to create a simple webpage, I felt empowered. Even a basic to-do list app made me feel like I could build something real.

## Cloning Airbnb

One of the best things I did early on was create a **clone of Airbnb** using basic front-end tools. This helped me:

- Practice responsive layouts with Flexbox and Grid  
- Understand how real-world websites are structured  
- Write clean, reusable code  
- Learn how to troubleshoot on my own
